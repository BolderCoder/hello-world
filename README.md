# hello-world
Learning about Git and sharing my BASIC code.

Hi! My name is Bill, and I have been programming in various dialects of BASIC since 1982. Commodore 64 Basic, GW-Basic, QuickBasic, and every flavors of Microsoft Visual Basic since version 2.

The BASIC language has never received a lot of respect. Other languages where cooler, faster, much more appreciated. Nevertheless, I managed to create some cool code to accomplish useful and interesting tasks such as printing bar codes for an inventory at Sears, automating the creation and administration of thousands of accounts with Novell Netware v4.11, dynamically creating thousands of web pages for a general news site I created in the late 90s, controlling and remotely accessing my Uniden BC-895 Scanner and Yaesu FT-840 Ham Radio, and providing a robust, error reducing, labor-saving front end for a proprietary web based dispatch system.

Stay tuned. Over the coming weeks, I will share as much of this code as I can recover from my fading CD-RWs while developing exciting new projects in Python and SAS.
